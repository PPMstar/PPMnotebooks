# 3D hydrodynamics simulations of core convection in supermassive main-sequence stars

This directory contains all the notebooks required to reproduce the figures shown in [Blouin et al. 2023](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.521.4605B/abstract). The table below indicates which notebook to use to reproduce a particular figure. These notebooks run on [https://www.ppmstar.org](https://www.ppmstar.org/) and [https://astrohub.uvic.ca](https://astrohub.uvic.ca/) using JupyterLab 3.0.
